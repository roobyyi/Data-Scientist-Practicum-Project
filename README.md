# Data Scientist Practicum Project

This is my Project Portfolio on Data Scientist Practicum Bootcamp.

---
Project 1 is about Basic in Python and how to handle a Data.

Project 2 is about how to handle duplicated data, missing data, and how to categorize data.

Project 3 is about how to visualize a data.

Project 4 is about how to do a hypothetical testing.

Integrated Project 1 is a Project that combine all material from Project 1, until Project 4.

Project 5 is about basic in SQL and scraping data from website.

Project 6 is about basic in machine learning, quality model metric such as accuracy, underfitting, overfitting, hyperparameter tuning, and introduction in Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.

Project 7 is about classification metrics such as recall, precision, and f1 score, PR Curve and ROC Curve, Upsampling and Downsampling.

Project 8 is about A/B Testing, Bootstrapping, and Cross-validation.

Integrated Project 2 is a Project that combine all material from Project 5, until Project 8.

Project 9 is about Linear Algebra, Vector, Matrices, and Fundamental in Linear Regression.

Project 10 is about Gradient Descent and Gradient Boost.

Project 11 is about Time Series.

Project 12 is about Natural Language Processing.

Project 13 is about Computer Vision.
